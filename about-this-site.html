        <h1>About this site</h1>
	<p>
	    The best system gets the job done while being as simple as possible.
	    That's the same philosophy I've taken when creating this website.
	</p>
	<p>
	    <strong>The purpose of this website is to share information.</strong>
	    Animations, eye candy, and general bloat may look pretty, but they typically don't add anything of substance
	    to a site's content.<sup>1</sup>
	    More often than not, all that extra work just ends up wasting man-hours and watt-hours.
	    So I've opted to keep this site as simple as possible to focus on what matters: content.
	</p>
	<p>
	    If you want to see something pretty, go outside! Nature has lots of that ðŸŒŽ
