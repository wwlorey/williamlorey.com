## Free Time

People tend to be intentional with the time
they put into their careers.

If a deadline is coming up, you set aside time
to meet it.

If you care about your job, you likely show up
with some intention.

The same can't be said for free time.

If you're anything like me, free time often involves
aimless scrolling through Instagram and giving in to 
the YouTube/Netflix siren song.

If I treated my work time like I sometimes treat my free time, I would hardly contribute at all to my team. And I
wouldn't have any of the satisfaction that comes with that.

I'm not suggesting that you should never veg out and scroll 
through insta.

I'm suggesting that being intentional with your time,
even when you aren't on the clock, is a rewarding
thing to do.
