## Amenities

They're perks, addons, and nice-to-haves that entice us
to make a purchase, take a job, or choose a place to live.

Everyone wants to live in an apartment complex with a gym;
it means they'll get fit.

Everyone after moving in never uses the gym.

We want to take advantage of the niceties our decisions make
available to us. We *aspire* to use our perks. 

But aspiring &#8800; perspiring.

Amenities are great and all, but if we don't ever use them
why did they carry so much weight when making decisions?
