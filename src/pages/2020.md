## A New Decade

<!-- It never occurred to me that how we tally each year is arbitrary.
But it is - long dead people could have all agreed to start counting 
years whenever they wanted to. Regardless, 2020 marks a milestone: the 
end of a decade. -->

10 years ago I had no idea what life right now would look like. I figured I
wouldn't see the end of high school, let alone do other things like move to a brand new city, 
graduate college, get a dog, meet some great friends, and fall in love.
It seemed impossible to project myself into the future and I can't say I'm 
any more confident about doing that now.

I'm not going to attempt to guess where my 2030 self will be in life. 
I'm simply going to point myself in a direction that seems best at the time
and work really hard at whatever tasks arise on that path. 
If college taught me anything, it's that hard work
makes you feel damn good (among other perks). That's what I aim to do this year and
this decade: choose a direction and work hard.
