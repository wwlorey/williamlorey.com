## Not Enough Time

I caught myself feeling bogged down - not having enough time.

Then I scrolled through Instagram for 15 minutes.

I had more time than I believed I did.

How we spend our time during stressful periods is a choice. We can 
make it hard on ourselves by wasting it, or we can do the
right thing right now and step towards the completion of a goal, 
even when it seems hard.
