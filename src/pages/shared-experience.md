## Shared Experience

In a world that seems to get smaller all the time,
people of many cultures interact more than ever
before. This is a beautiful thing, and the power
that shared experiences between people have
shouldn't be forgotten.

Shared experience unites people. That's why we
tend to become close with our classmates in school
despite perhaps being quite different from them; we were all
are in that situation together.

Forging new relationships through shared experience is about bringing your 
own perspective to the table - in whatever situation
you're all in - and allowing for your unique cultural foundation
to persist while accepting new, potentially powerful bonds that can 
form here and now.
