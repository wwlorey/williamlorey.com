## Better Goals

My goal this January was to publish a blog post every day. 

Almost every day, I published my work. And when I wrote something that
didn't seem to add value, I published it anyway.

This exercise provided two lessons:

### 1. I'm lazy and my goals should account for that

I wrote a lot in January - much more than I had in the previous
several months. But because my goal was to publish *something*
every day, I took the easiest route. On days where I was in a time
crunch, I would crank something out in 15 minutes. Yes it was 
publishable, but was I proud to put my name on that work? No,
not really.

Instead, a different kind of goal should have been created. 
One that was less rigid, not requiring A+ quality writing to be 
done every single day...

### 2. Showing up  with intention is more important than putting out

If I had instead set my goal to simply write for an hour a day,
I would have spent much more time writing - without being obligated
to publish work I wasn't proud of. The space would have been created 
to drudge through all the writing I wasn't satisfied with until I wrote
something that hit the mark. And if that never happened - if I spent the
month simply writing with no shiny end product, at least I would
have been cultivating a skill. It would still have been an hour 
well spent, everyday.

Of course it would be nice to publish value-adding work every day
(see [Seth Godin](https://seths.blog/)), but for that to be the
crux of the goal misses the bigger picture: producing quality work
requires gobs and gobs of drudgery, setbacks, and failure. 
If the goal is purely focused on hitting that "publish" button,
setbacks aren't expected/accepted and hard work isn't revered
when it must be.

The goal (and with it the satisfaction from hitting the mark) 
should instead hinge on the process in all its time-consuming 
muddiness. This restructuring assigns value appropriately so 
there's more fulfillment in the work you do.
