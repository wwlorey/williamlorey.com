## High-strung

Identifying with feelings of stress/anxiety
leaves you high-strung.

This impedes your performance, sucks joy from
whatever situation you're caught up in, and brings
others around you down as well.

The cure for being high-strung is a conscious breath, 
a pause, and a logical step in the right direction.
