<h1 class="title">Shared Experience</h1>
<p>In a world that seems to get smaller all the time, people of many cultures interact more than ever before. This is a beautiful thing, and the power that shared experiences between people have shouldn’t be forgotten.</p>
<p>Shared experience unites people. That’s why we tend to become close with our classmates in school despite perhaps being quite different from them; we were all are in that situation together.</p>
<p>Forging new relationships through shared experience is about bringing your own perspective to the table - in whatever situation you’re all in - and allowing for your unique cultural foundation to persist while accepting new, potentially powerful bonds that can form here and now.</p>
