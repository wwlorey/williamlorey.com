        <h2>Shared Experience</h2>
    <p>
        In a world that seems to get smaller all the time,
        people of many cultures interact more than ever
        before. This is a beautiful thing, and the power
        that shared experiences between people have
        shouldn't be forgotten.
    </p>
        
    <p>
        Shared experience unites people. That's why we
        tend to become close with our classmates in school
        despite perhaps being quite different from them; we were all
        are in that situation together.
    </p>
        
    <p>
        Forging new relationships through shared experience is about bringing your 
        own perspective to the table - in whatever situation
        you're all in - and allowing for your unique cultural foundation
        to persist while accepting new, potentially powerful bonds that can 
        form here and now.
