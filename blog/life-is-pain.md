This simple formula governs how shitty life is:

`suffering = pain * resistance`

Part of the blessing/curse of being human is that we
all will experience pain in our lives. This can't
be avoided. Although we all try to.

Resistance is our way of trying to skirt around pain.
Our thoughts turn to self criticism and complaining
in our attempt to avoid unpleasantness:

"This shouldn't be happening to me." 

"How dare they treat me that way."

"I can't believe I acted like that."

We're like toddlers - believing that if we just complain
enough, we'll get what we want: to stop experiencing
whatever pain is present.

As resistance approaches zero, so does suffering. You
get to decide if you'll accept pain and deal with it,
or futilely resist in the childish attempt to be
completely free of pain.
