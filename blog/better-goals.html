<h1 class="title">Better Goals</h1>
<p>My goal this January was to publish a blog post every day.</p>
<p>Almost every day, I published my work. And when I wrote something that didn’t seem to add value, I published it anyway.</p>
<p>This exercise provided two lessons:</p>
<h3 id="im-lazy-and-my-goals-should-account-for-that">1. I’m lazy and my goals should account for that</h3>
<p>I wrote a lot in January - much more than I had in the previous several months. But because my goal was to publish <em>something</em> every day, I took the easiest route. On days where I was in a time crunch, I would crank something out in 15 minutes. Yes it was publishable, but was I proud to put my name on that work? No, not really.</p>
<p>Instead, a different kind of goal should have been created. One that was less rigid, not requiring A+ quality writing to be done every single day…</p>
<h3 id="showing-up-with-intention-is-more-important-than-putting-out">2. Showing up with intention is more important than putting out</h3>
<p>If I had instead set my goal to simply write for an hour a day, I would have spent much more time writing - without being obligated to publish work I wasn’t proud of. The space would have been created to drudge through all the writing I wasn’t satisfied with until I wrote something that hit the mark. And if that never happened - if I spent the month simply writing with no shiny end product, at least I would have been cultivating a skill. It would still have been an hour well spent, everyday.</p>
<p>Of course it would be nice to publish value-adding work every day (see <a href="https://seths.blog/">Seth Godin</a>), but for that to be the crux of the goal misses the bigger picture: producing quality work requires gobs and gobs of drudgery, setbacks, and failure. If the goal is purely focused on hitting that “publish” button, setbacks aren’t expected/accepted and hard work isn’t revered when it must be.</p>
<p>The goal (and with it the satisfaction from hitting the mark) should instead hinge on the process in all its time-consuming muddiness. This restructuring assigns value appropriately so there’s more fulfillment in the work you do.</p>
