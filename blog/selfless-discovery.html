        <h2>A Strategy for Selfless Discovery</h2>

        <p>
        One of the foundations of meditation is the
        fact that there is no center to our experience,
        no self from which we take in the world.
        Paying attention (meditating) can take on a 
        very different character if this concept is grasped.
        </p>
        
        <p>
        <a href='https://samharris.org/' target='_blank'>Sam Harris</a> as a
        part of his meditation course encourages this
        discovery of selflessness partly through Douglass
        Harding's teachings on
        <a href='http://www.headless.org/on-having-no-head.htm' target='_blank'>having no head</a>. While this can be very powerful
        for some, I found the instruction at times difficult to
        use as a means of returning to a state of selflessness in
        my own practice.
        </p>
        
        <p>
        So instead of <em>looking</em> for the self, I started asking
        for it to appear.
        </p>
        
        <p>
        I would gaze down at my hands
        and ask "whose hands are these?" (not out loud but
        mentally.) The answer that arose, if any,
        could be noticed as a mere appearance in consciousness -
        certainly not as a self claiming ownership.
        </p>
        
        <p>
        In the absence of the appearance of a self, I found the
        "headless", selfless quality touted by Harris and others.
        While it doesn't last for long, its implications are
        nonetheless integral to understanding the bedrock
        of human experience.
