We make our lives more difficult than they need to be. 
So much of our time is wasted every day on things that are
simply **out of our control**.

The last time you were stuck in traffic, did you feel uneasy?

Did you dread the impending workweek on Sunday night?

Is there something that you did, or something that was
done to you, that still breeds anxiety? Even years later?

Unfortunately, all stressors can't be removed from
anyone's life. To do so would be to take away the humanity of our
experience - as imperfection is a part of being human.

The only thing you can do is change your *relationship* with what
arises in life. When you stop trying to control what you 
can't control, life starts to look a lot different.
