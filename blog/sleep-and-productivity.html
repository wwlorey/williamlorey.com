        <h2>Sleep and Productivity</h2>
        <p>
        To show up as the best version of ourselves,
we need a requisite amount of sleep.
        </p>

        <p>
To be satisfied with our work<sup>*</sup>,
relationships, and habits, we need time.
        </p>

        <p>
Giving up sleep to pursue these endeavors works in the short
term. But there are so many other, less important time sucks
we could give up instead.
        </p>

        <p>
<sup>*</sup><i>Our work in the world, not necessarily
how we get a paycheck.</i>
        </p>
