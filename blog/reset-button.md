We get caught in our ruts, habitually going
about our lives as we always do.

Hitting the reset button wakes you up and gives you
space to point yourself in a new direction.

It doesn't take much:

A walk around the neighborhood.

A new audiobook.

A chat with a friend.

A quiet evening free from distractions.

Take the time to identify what reset button(s)
break the spell of unconsciously carrying on.
Leaving your head in the sand isn't worth the
short-term ease of putting off long-term thinking.
