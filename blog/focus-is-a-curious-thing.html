<h1 class="title">Focus is a Curious Thing</h1>
<p>If we really attend to the act of focusing, it can be noticed that there isn’t a focuser and an object of focus. There’s just a single continuum of focus.</p>
<p>This truth is glimpsed only briefly - before our sense of self seeps back into experience.</p>
<p>Sometimes we all have trouble focusing on something. But how can we struggle with such a simple task?</p>
<p>Even the feelings of mental fogginess and waning focus can be clearly experienced.</p>
