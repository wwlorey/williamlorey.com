        <h2>Focus is a Curious Thing</h2>

        <p>
        If we really attend to the act of focusing, it can be noticed that there isn't a 
        focuser and an object of focus. There's just a single continuum of focus.
        <p>

        <p>
        This truth is glimpsed only briefly - before our sense of self seeps back into
        experience.
        <p>

        <p>
        Sometimes we all have trouble focusing on something. But how can we struggle
        with such a simple task?
        <p>

        <p>
        Even the feelings of mental fogginess and waning focus can be clearly experienced.
