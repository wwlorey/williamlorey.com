        <h2>Intentional Binging</h2>

        <p>
        Is it more fulfilling to: <br/>
(a) watch Netflix from the moment you wake up to the moment you fall asleep, or <br/>
(b) spend the morning being productive, then watch Netflix for three hours that afternoon.
        </p>

        <p>
In both instances, you appease your monkey mind with mindless entertainment.
This is something we all need - we all need to turn our mind off sometimes, 
and sitting in front of a TV is a great way to do that.
        </p>

        <p>
The problem arises when good-natured tranquility seeking turns into an
all day, self-loathing-inducing couch potato session.
        </p>

        <p>
This can be avoided. Simply make a contract with yourself: resolve to binge
for only half an hour. Or for ten. Just be intentional with how long you
let yourself be a slave to the YouTube rabbit hole.
        </p>

        <p>
A day filled solely with lazing around can be transformed from regretful to restful
by limiting the time you binge, and by doing a few things you <em>know</em> you should do in
addition to your relaxation:
go for a run, eat a healthy meal, cross something off the todo list, etc.
        </p>

        <p>
The goal here is to avoid unbridled hedonism, and with it dissatisfaction.
