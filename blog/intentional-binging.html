<h1 class="title">Intentional Binging</h1>
<p>Is it more fulfilling to: <br/> (a) watch Netflix from the moment you wake up to the moment you fall asleep, or <br/> (b) spend the morning being productive, then watch Netflix for three hours that afternoon.</p>
<p>In both instances, you appease your monkey mind with mindless entertainment. This is something we all need - we all need to turn our mind off sometimes, and sitting in front of a TV is a great way to do that.</p>
<p>The problem arises when good-natured tranquility seeking turns into an all day, self-loathing-inducing couch potato session.</p>
<p>This can be avoided. Simply make a contract with yourself: resolve to binge for only half an hour. Or for ten. Just be intentional with how long you let yourself be a slave to the YouTube rabbit hole.</p>
<p>A day filled solely with lazing around can be transformed from regretful to restful by limiting the time you binge, and by doing a few things you <em>know</em> you should do in addition to your relaxation: go for a run, eat a healthy meal, cross something off the todo list, etc.</p>
<p>The goal here is to avoid unbridled hedonism, and with it dissatisfaction.</p>
