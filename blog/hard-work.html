        <h2>Hard Work</h2>

        <p>
        Contribution through hard work is repaid with 
        satisfaction and respect from yourself and from others. 
        This can come at a cost, though.
        </p>

        <p>
        Do you step up to the plate when hard work
        needs to be done? What do you give up to do so?
        </p>

        <p>
        Striking a balance between steady, meaningful contribution
        (hard work) and self care is crucial.
        </p>
