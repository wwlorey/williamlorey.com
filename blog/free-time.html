        <h2>Free Time</h2>
        <p>
        People tend to be intentional with the time
        they put into their careers.
        </p>

        <p>
        If a deadline is coming up, you set aside time
        to meet it.
        </p>

        <p>
        If you care about your job, you likely show up
        with some intention.
        </p>

        <p>
        The same can't be said for free time.
        </p>

        <p>
        If you're anything like me, free time often involves
        aimless scrolling through Instagram and giving in to 
        the YouTube/Netflix siren song.
        </p>

        <p>
        If I treated my work time like I sometimes treat my free time, I would hardly contribute at all to my team. And I
        wouldn't have any of the satisfaction that comes with that.
        </p>

        <p>
        I'm not suggesting that you should never veg out and scroll 
        through insta.
        </p>

        <p>
        I'm suggesting that being intentional with your time,
        even when you aren't on the clock, is a rewarding
        thing to do.
