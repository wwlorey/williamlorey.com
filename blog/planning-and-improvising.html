        <h2>Planning and Improvising</h2>

        <p>
        There's a fine line to walk between planning and 
improvising.
        </p>

        <p>
Plan too much and you'll get diminishing returns as well as
the additional stress of adhering to an over-optimized
schedule.
        </p>

        <p>
Don't plan enough and you float from task to task, 
improvising your next move and making
progress in a wishy-washy way.
        </p>

        <p>
The right combination is different for everyone. And the bright
side is that regardless of how much you plan, it's never
set in stone.
