        <h2>Not Enough Time</h2>

    <p>
        I caught myself feeling bogged down - not having enough time.
    </p>

    <p>
Then I scrolled through Instagram for 15 minutes.
    </p>

    <p>
I had more time than I believed I did.
    </p>

    <p>
How we spend our time during stressful periods is a choice. We can 
make it hard on ourselves by wasting it, or we can do the
right thing right now and step towards the completion of a goal, 
even when it seems hard.
