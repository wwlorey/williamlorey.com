<h1 class="title">Not Enough Time</h1>
<p>I caught myself feeling bogged down - not having enough time.</p>
<p>Then I scrolled through Instagram for 15 minutes.</p>
<p>I had more time than I believed I did.</p>
<p>How we spend our time during stressful periods is a choice. We can make it hard on ourselves by wasting it, or we can do the right thing right now and step towards the completion of a goal, even when it seems hard.</p>
