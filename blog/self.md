title: "The Self"

People who say they know themselves can be categorized as
either down to earth or misguided. 
I think the latter categorization is the only plausible one.

The self doesn't exist. As a matter of experience, we 
are *processes*, not tangible selves riding around
in our heads. We are compelled by thought to act in certain
ways depending on our situation. The decisions we make, how we navigate
the world: that's who we are as people. This is a complicated and expansive
definition of who each of us really is. People can't simply be categorized
and constrained as a self by the definition we place on that term today.

Since there isn't a self to know, you can't really know yourself.
