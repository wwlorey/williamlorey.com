## Coffee

I was a self-proclaimed coffee caveman.
I had no clue what all this hipster coffee lingo meant: "blooming your
grounds", "notes of chocolate", "instant coffee is bad."

Until recently, I had zero opinion on coffee. Thankfully, a friend took me
under his wing and showed me the ropes of high class, pour over coffee goodness.

It struck me what a different experience drinking thoughtfully prepared coffee was compared
to my normal instant coffee concoctions. I had been drinking coffee for the caffeine 
bump only - ignoring what could have also been a rich sensory experience.

It makes me wonder what else in life would be made that much
better if I introduced a bit of thoughtfulness to those things that are
simply "good enough."
