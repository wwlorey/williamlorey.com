You know the feeling I'm talking about; the one you 
get when you know you 
should do something but are too afraid to do it.

If it's too scary to do the thing, ask "what's the
worst that can happen?"

Failure is never as bad as we assume it will be.

And what if instead of failing, you succeed?

You don't know what's possible if you always
listen to that feeling.
