        <h2>Find Your Reset Button(s)</h2>

        <p>
        We get caught in our ruts, habitually going
about our lives as we always do.
        </p>

        <p>
Hitting the reset button wakes you up and gives you
space to point yourself in a new direction.
        </p>

        <p>
It doesn't take much:
        </p>

        <p>
A walk around the neighborhood.
        </p>

        <p>
A new audiobook.
        </p>

        <p>
A chat with a friend.
        </p>

        <p>
A quiet evening free from distractions.
        </p>

        <p>
Take the time to identify what reset button(s)
break the spell of unconsciously carrying on.
Leaving your head in the sand isn't worth the
short-term ease of putting off long-term thinking.
