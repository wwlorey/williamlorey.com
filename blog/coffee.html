<h1 class="title">Coffee</h1>
<p>I was a self-proclaimed coffee caveman. I had no clue what all this hipster coffee lingo meant: “blooming your grounds”, “notes of chocolate”, “instant coffee is bad.”</p>
<p>Until recently, I had zero opinion on coffee. Thankfully, a friend took me under his wing and showed me the ropes of high class, pour over coffee goodness.</p>
<p>It struck me what a different experience drinking thoughtfully prepared coffee was compared to my normal instant coffee concoctions. I had been drinking coffee for the caffeine bump only - ignoring what could have also been a rich sensory experience.</p>
<p>It makes me wonder what else in life would be made that much better if I introduced a bit of thoughtfulness to those things that are simply “good enough.”</p>
