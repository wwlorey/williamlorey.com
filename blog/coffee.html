        <h2>Coffee</h2>

        <p>
        I was a self-proclaimed coffee caveman.
        I had no clue what all this hipster coffee lingo meant: "blooming your
        grounds", "notes of chocolate", "instant coffee is bad."
        </p>

        <p>
        Until recently, I had zero opinion on coffee. Thankfully, a friend took me
        under his wing and showed me the ropes of high class, pour over coffee goodness.
        </p>

        <p>
        It struck me what a different experience drinking thoughtfully prepared coffee was compared
        to my normal instant coffee concoctions. I had been drinking coffee for the caffeine 
        bump only - ignoring what could have also been a rich sensory experience.
        </p>

        <p>
        It makes me wonder what else in life would be made that much
        better if I introduced a bit of thoughtfulness to those things that are
        simply "good enough."
