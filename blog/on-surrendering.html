        <h2>On Surrendering</h2>

        <p>
        We make our lives more difficult than they need to be. 
        So much of our time is wasted every day on things that are
        simply <strong>out of our control</strong>.
        </p>
        
        <p>
        The last time you were stuck in traffic, did you feel uneasy?
        </p>
        
        <p>
        Did you dread the impending workweek on Sunday night?
        </p>
        
        <p>
        Is there something that you did, or something that was
        done to you, that still breeds anxiety? Even years later?
        </p>
        
        <p>
        Unfortunately, all stressors can't be removed from
        anyone's life. To do so would be to take away the humanity of our
        experience - as imperfection is a part of being human.
        </p>
        
        <p>
        The only thing you can do is change your <em>relationship</em> with what
        arises in life. When you stop trying to control what you 
        can't control, life starts to look a lot different.
