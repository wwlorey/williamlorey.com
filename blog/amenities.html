<h1 class="title">Amenities</h1>
<p>They’re perks, addons, and nice-to-haves that entice us to make a purchase, take a job, or choose a place to live.</p>
<p>Everyone wants to live in an apartment complex with a gym; it means they’ll get fit.</p>
<p>Everyone after moving in never uses the gym.</p>
<p>We want to take advantage of the niceties our decisions make available to us. We <em>aspire</em> to use our perks.</p>
<p>But aspiring ≠ perspiring.</p>
<p>Amenities are great and all, but if we don’t ever use them why did they carry so much weight when making decisions?</p>
