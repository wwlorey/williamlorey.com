        <h2>Amenities</h2>

        <p>
        They're perks, addons, and nice-to-haves that entice us
        to make a purchase, take a job, or choose a place to live.
        </p>

        <p>
        Everyone wants to live in an apartment complex with a gym;
        it means they'll get fit.
        </p>

        <p>
        Everyone after moving in never uses the gym.
        </p>

        <p>
        We want to take advantage of the niceties our decisions make
        available to us. We <em>aspire</em> to use our perks. 
        </p>

        <p>
        But aspiring &#8800; perspiring.
        </p>

        <p>
        Amenities are great and all, but if we don't ever use them
        why did they carry so much weight when making decisions?
