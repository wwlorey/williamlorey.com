        <h2>High-strung</h2>

        <p>
        Identifying with feelings of stress/anxiety
        leaves you high-strung.
        </p>

        <p>
        This impedes your performance, sucks joy from
        whatever situation you're caught up in, and brings
        others around you down as well.
        </p>

        <p>
        The cure for being high-strung is a conscious breath, 
        a pause, and a logical step in the right direction.
        </p>
