To show up as the best version of ourselves,
we need a requisite amount of sleep.

To be satisfied with our work,<sup>\*</sup> 
relationships, and habits, we need time.

Giving up sleep to pursue these endeavors works in the short
term. But there are so many other, less important time sucks
we could give up instead.

<sup>\*</sup> *Our work in the world, not necessarily
how we get a paycheck.*
