## Hard Work

Contribution through hard work is repaid with 
satisfaction and respect from yourself and from others. 
This can come at a cost, though.

Do you step up to the plate when hard work
needs to be done? What do you give up to do so?

Striking a balance between steady, meaningful contribution
(hard work) and self care is crucial.
