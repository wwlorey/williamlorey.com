        I started out on the team as and Electrical Sub-Team member and took on the position of Logistics Manager during my Sophomore year. My responsibilities
        now include managing the Logistics Sub-Team, writing embedded software, and contributing to the car's telemetry code base. I also make a lot of wires.

        The summer after my Freshman year I interned in Information Technology at Boeing. Most notably during my time at the company,
        myself and a team of Boeing interns in St. Louis (pictured above) were tasked with finding a way to leverage innovation in our
        department, IT Common Services (ITCS). Competing against another team in Seattle in the 'ITCS Intern Challenge', we designed and built a
        social network for aggregating and cultivating innovation from IT employees. We presented our solution to our director and his leadership
        team and won the competition.
