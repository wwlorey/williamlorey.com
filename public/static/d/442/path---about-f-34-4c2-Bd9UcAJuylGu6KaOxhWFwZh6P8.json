{"data":{"markdownRemark":{"html":"<h2>About Will</h2>\n<p>This spring, I graduated college with a B.S. in Computer Engineering\nand a minor in Computer Science - somehow with a <strong>4.0 GPA</strong>.\nCollege was the first time in my life that I <strong>worked my ass off and\nsaw the results I was looking for</strong>. While in school, I interned at\n<strong>Boeing</strong>,\n<strong>LMI Aerospace</strong>,\nand <strong>Garmin</strong>, spent an\nunseemly amount of time\nworking with and leading my university's\n<a href=\"http://solarcar.mst.edu\">solar car team</a> as an\nElectrical/Software Team Member and\nas President, and took up the religion of technical interview prep (complete\nwith <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/Cracking-Coding-Interview-Programming-Questions/dp/0984782850\">bible</a>).</p>\n<p>Here's what a few of my managers had to say about me along the way:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>\"Overall, Will exceeded my expectations for his\nperformance values as an intern. He is very professional,\ninnovative, and has great presentation skills.\" - Jessica Poor, Boeing</p>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote>\n<p>\"Willâ€™s overall performance exceeded expectations for a software engineering\nintern... Will spent a lot of his time outside of the internship\nleading his solar car project for the university.\nThe fact that he was able to support both was a good demonstration of\nhis 'high throughput' capabilities.\" - Ted Mabie, Garmin</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>That's not to say my time wasn't spent without failures\n(yeah 2018 solar car race, I'm talking about you). But life's a mixed bag. All\nyou can do is learn from your experience and get better - at least that's what\nI'm trying to do.</p>\n<p>My work paid off when I landed my dream job as a\nSoftware Engineer at <strong>Microsoft</strong>. I'll be starting in their Seattle office\nthis fall and I couldn't be more grateful for the opportunity.</p>\n<p>At this point in my life, I did the work, I got the degree, the job, and the\n<a href=\"https://www.census.gov/topics/families/families-and-households.html\">1.86 children</a>\nsupporting salary, but I feel like I have yet to really explore my passions and\nfind what drives me. The biggest life lesson I've learned to date is that\n<strong>I don't know what the hell to do with my life</strong> and I've set\nout to find some answers.</p>\n<p>That's what this website is about: me trying things out - seeing what I like,\nwhat I hate, what fuels me, and what makes me want to steer my life in different directions.\nSo if you're into that, stick around because that's my journey and I hope watching\nit unfold won't disappoint.</p>\n<p>Thanks for reading.</p>\n<p><a\n    class=\"gatsby-resp-image-link\"\n    href=\"/static/3392988c4b3b2a672c411c9afa6ae227/d19c0/sig.png\"\n    style=\"display: block\"\n    target=\"_blank\"\n    rel=\"noopener\"\n  >\n    <span\n    class=\"gatsby-resp-image-wrapper\"\n    style=\"position: relative; display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;  max-width: 500px;\"\n  >\n    <span\n      class=\"gatsby-resp-image-background-image\"\n      style=\"padding-bottom: 49.6%; position: relative; bottom: 0; left: 0; background-image: url('data:image/png;base64,iVBORw0KGgoAAAANSUhEUgAAABQAAAAKCAYAAAC0VX7mAAAACXBIWXMAAAsSAAALEgHS3X78AAAAyUlEQVQoz62T3QqCQBCFR/uhsigr+4HcLiozKzIr6ia66El6/5foLJyFJfQiceADZ9iZOcdVkeKYgQWfHakgTmAgFca1rLo67dnNY3ABfRD9O7AJbqBn1RJw59CEtS7R56bAL3KgVXzAmXkAjiClbcV6h042vKwYeHkK3+AJlswfoAVeVB7QRUrVelgNhFQf8gJNv4yACzI2ZByqF+3AFuy5QFHlAazBhAtdnoltpT7RNlag8fOOPC43MaRCZdXmUuLTcHJ+gLZJvgnJCy11AYyfAAAAAElFTkSuQmCC'); background-size: cover; display: block;\"\n    ></span>\n    <img\n        class=\"gatsby-resp-image-image\"\n        style=\"width:100%;height:100%;margin:0;vertical-align:middle;position:absolute;top:0;left:0;box-shadow:inset 0px 0px 0px 400px white;\"\n        alt=\"signature\"\n        title=\"\"\n        src=\"/static/3392988c4b3b2a672c411c9afa6ae227/d19c0/sig.png\"\n        srcset=\"/static/3392988c4b3b2a672c411c9afa6ae227/02020/sig.png 243w,\n/static/3392988c4b3b2a672c411c9afa6ae227/d40d9/sig.png 485w,\n/static/3392988c4b3b2a672c411c9afa6ae227/d19c0/sig.png 500w\"\n        sizes=\"(max-width: 500px) 100vw, 500px\"\n      />\n  </span>\n  </a></p>\n<div style=\"margin-top: 1rem; width: 12rem;\">\n  <a class=\"gatsby-resp-image-link\" href=\"/static/3392988c4b3b2a672c411c9afa6ae227/d19c0/sig.png\" style=\"display: block\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">\n    <span class=\"gatsby-resp-image-wrapper\" style=\"position: relative; display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;  max-width: 500px;\">\n    <span class=\"gatsby-resp-image-background-image\" style=\"padding-bottom: 49.6%; position: relative; bottom: 0; left: 0; background-image: url(&apos;data:image/png;base64,iVBORw0KGgoAAAANSUhEUgAAABQAAAAKCAYAAAC0VX7mAAAACXBIWXMAAAsSAAALEgHS3X78AAAAyUlEQVQoz62T3QqCQBCFR/uhsigr+4HcLiozKzIr6ia66El6/5foLJyFJfQiceADZ9iZOcdVkeKYgQWfHakgTmAgFca1rLo67dnNY3ABfRD9O7AJbqBn1RJw59CEtS7R56bAL3KgVXzAmXkAjiClbcV6h042vKwYeHkK3+AJlswfoAVeVB7QRUrVelgNhFQf8gJNv4yACzI2ZByqF+3AFuy5QFHlAazBhAtdnoltpT7RNlag8fOOPC43MaRCZdXmUuLTcHJ+gLZJvgnJCy11AYyfAAAAAElFTkSuQmCC&apos;); background-size: cover; display: block;\"></span>\n    <img class=\"gatsby-resp-image-image\" style=\"width:100%;height:100%;margin:0;vertical-align:middle;position:absolute;top:0;left:0;box-shadow:inset 0px 0px 0px 400px white;\" alt=\"Will&apos;s signature\" title src=\"/static/3392988c4b3b2a672c411c9afa6ae227/d19c0/sig.png\" srcset=\"/static/3392988c4b3b2a672c411c9afa6ae227/02020/sig.png 243w,\n/static/3392988c4b3b2a672c411c9afa6ae227/d40d9/sig.png 485w,\n/static/3392988c4b3b2a672c411c9afa6ae227/d19c0/sig.png 500w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 500px) 100vw, 500px\">\n  </span>\n  </a>\n  <p style=\"display: block; font-size: 1rem;\">June `19</p>\n</div>","frontmatter":{"title":""}}},"pageContext":{"isCreatedByStatefulCreatePages":false,"slug":"/about/"}}
