      I spent the better part of my time in college working on stuff that
      <b>didn't make me happy</b>. Set aside the school work, I'm talking
      extracurriculars. The work I was doing on the S&T Solar Car Team was cool
      and fast paced, but I struggled to find the value in it. Because of my
      commitment to that activity, I sacrificed my health, and relationships. I
      backed out of family vacations and spent less time doing things that made
      me happy. It wasn't until I took a step back that I realized that
      <b>working for the sake of work</b> was not the path I wanted to go down.
      I took time to reconsider what I wanted my life to look like.

      I'm lucky enough to have a say in what work I spend my life doing. While
      my focus may change throughout my life, my current focus is
      <b>building stuff for the web</b>.
