title: "Breaded Tofu"
---

## Ingredients
* Tofu - extra firm or the super firm high protein type work the best.
* Soy Sauce - or Tamari or Bragg's Liquid Aminos for flavor and to moisten the tofu and help the coating stick.
* Bread Crumbs - You can also crumble and use any of the following:
    * crackers (any vegan cracker will work)
    * a vegan stuffing (like Pepperidge Farm's cornbread stuffing mix).
    * corn flakes (GF)
    * corn chips (GF)
    * Spicy Sweet Chili or Blaze flavored Doritos cornmeal. (GF)

* Flour - you can use white, whole wheat, or gluten-free flour mix.  This helps creates a coating that sticks to the tofu and crisps up when cooked.
* Corn Starch - to help the breading be extra crispy.  (optional)
* Nutritional Yeast - for flavor.  Optional, but recommended.
* Spices - this can vary depending on the flavor that you want to achieve.  I like to use poultry seasoning for a chicken nugget flavored tofu or Italian seasoning if I'm serving it with pasta or something Italian flavored.  I also like to use Tony Chachere's for a spicy creole flavored tofu too.
* Salt - for flavor.  (You may want to reduce or omit if your spices already have salt in them).

## Instructions
1. Drain and press a block of tofu getting out as much liquid as possible.
2. Mix together breading ingredients on a plate or shallow dish.
3. Sprinkle tofu with some soy sauce or equivalent.
4. Place the tofu in the breading and press down a little to make the coating stick to the tofu.
5. Flip over and coat the other side.

Now you have 2 choices to cook your tofu baking or pan frying.

### Baking
1. Preheat the oven to 400°F.
2. Spread about 2 tbsp of oil on the bottom of a cookie sheet.
3. Place the breaded tofu on the cookie sheet and bake at 400°F for about 20 minutes.
4. After 20 minutes, take out of the oven and flip with a spatula.
5. Bake for an additional 20 minutes on the other side.

### Pan frying
1. Place 2 tbsp of oil in the bottom of a skillet. (I highly recommend using an iron skillet for tofu.  It always cooks perfectly and never sticks to my iron skillet).
2. Place the coated tofu in the frying pan and turn heat 
3. Cook for about 3-5 minutes on each side until golden brown and crunchy.
