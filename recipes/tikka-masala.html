        <h3>For the tofu tikka masala:</h3>
        <ul>
        <li>12 oz extra-firm tofu (1 normal package)</li>
        <li>1 tbsp coconut oil</li>
        <li>1 tsp cumin seeds</li>
        <li>1 large yellow onion diced</li>
        <li>4 cloves garlic minced</li>
        <li>1 inch ginger peeled and minced</li>
        <li>2 green chili peppers finely chopped</li>
        <li>1 red bell pepper diced</li>
        <li>3 tbsp nutritional yeast</li>
        <li>6 tbsp tomato paste</li>
        <li>2 cups cherry tomatoes quartered (or use 1 14-oz. can diced tomatoes, drained)</li>
        <li>1 can full-fat coconut milk (1 and 3/4 cups)</li>
        <li>2 tbsp white wine vinegar</li>
        <li>1 tsp coconut sugar (optional - or use brown sugar)</li>
        <li>salt to taste</li>
        <li>freshly-squeezed lemon juice to taste, for serving</li>
        <li>chopped fresh cilantro (coriander) to taste, for serving</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Instructions</h2>
        <ol>
        <li>Drain excess liquid from the tofu package. Wrap the tofu in several clean towels and place a heavy object on top of it. (Alternately, use a tofu press). Press the tofu for 10-15 minutes - to save time, I start this before I chop and prep other ingredients.</li>
        <li>Mix together all of the spices and set aside. Heat the coconut oil in a skillet over medium heat, and add the diced onion with a pinch of salt. Cook the onion, stirring occasionally, until translucent and starting to lightly brown, 4 to 6 minutes.</li>
        <li>Add the cumin seeds and cook for 60 seconds more. Add the garlic, ginger, and chili pepper, and cook for another 60 seconds. Stir in all of the spice mixture and cook, stirring constantly, just until fragrant, about 45 seconds.</li>
        <li>Add the bell pepper, nutritional yeast, and tomato paste, and cook for 2 more minutes, stirring frequently. Finally, add the tomatoes and stir well, scraping around the bottom of the pan. Cook for 3-4 minutes or until the tomatoes are starting to soften. Turn off the heat.</li>
        <li>Cut the pressed tofu into small cubes. Lightly spray or grease the bottom of your slow cooker. Add the coconut milk, white wine vinegar, and coconut sugar to the slow cooker, and stir to combine. Use a spatula to add all of the mixture from the skillet. Add the tofu and stir gently.</li>
        <li>Cook on low for 4 to 6 hours, or on high for 2 to 3 hours. Alternately, cook under pressure in your Instant Pot for 10 to 15 minutes; or on the stovetop for about 30 minutes at a simmer, stirring occasionally.<br/>NO SLOW COOKER: Bring the mixture to a boil in a saucepan. Reduce to a gentle simmer, then cook covered for 25-30 minutes, stirring occasionally, or until tomatoes are broken down and tofu has absorbed the sauce flavor.</li>

        <li>After cooking, season to taste with additional salt, and fresh lemon juice. Serve with rice or accompaniments of choice, garnished with fresh cilantro.</li>
        </ol>
