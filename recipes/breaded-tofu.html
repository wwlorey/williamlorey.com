<h1 class="title">Breaded Tofu</h1>
<h2 id="ingredients">Ingredients</h2>
<ul>
<li>Tofu - extra firm or the super firm high protein type work the best.</li>
<li>Soy Sauce - or Tamari or Bragg’s Liquid Aminos for flavor and to moisten the tofu and help the coating stick.</li>
<li>Bread Crumbs - You can also crumble and use any of the following:
<ul>
<li>crackers (any vegan cracker will work)</li>
<li>a vegan stuffing (like Pepperidge Farm’s cornbread stuffing mix).</li>
<li>corn flakes (GF)</li>
<li>corn chips (GF)</li>
<li>Spicy Sweet Chili or Blaze flavored Doritos cornmeal. (GF)</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Flour - you can use white, whole wheat, or gluten-free flour mix. This helps creates a coating that sticks to the tofu and crisps up when cooked.</li>
<li>Corn Starch - to help the breading be extra crispy. (optional)</li>
<li>Nutritional Yeast - for flavor. Optional, but recommended.</li>
<li>Spices - this can vary depending on the flavor that you want to achieve. I like to use poultry seasoning for a chicken nugget flavored tofu or Italian seasoning if I’m serving it with pasta or something Italian flavored. I also like to use Tony Chachere’s for a spicy creole flavored tofu too.</li>
<li>Salt - for flavor. (You may want to reduce or omit if your spices already have salt in them).</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="instructions">Instructions</h2>
<ol type="1">
<li>Drain and press a block of tofu getting out as much liquid as possible.</li>
<li>Mix together breading ingredients on a plate or shallow dish.</li>
<li>Sprinkle tofu with some soy sauce or equivalent.</li>
<li>Place the tofu in the breading and press down a little to make the coating stick to the tofu.</li>
<li>Flip over and coat the other side.</li>
</ol>
<p>Now you have 2 choices to cook your tofu baking or pan frying.</p>
<h3 id="baking">Baking</h3>
<ol type="1">
<li>Preheat the oven to 400°F.</li>
<li>Spread about 2 tbsp of oil on the bottom of a cookie sheet.</li>
<li>Place the breaded tofu on the cookie sheet and bake at 400°F for about 20 minutes.</li>
<li>After 20 minutes, take out of the oven and flip with a spatula.</li>
<li>Bake for an additional 20 minutes on the other side.</li>
</ol>
<h3 id="pan-frying">Pan frying</h3>
<ol type="1">
<li>Place 2 tbsp of oil in the bottom of a skillet. (I highly recommend using an iron skillet for tofu. It always cooks perfectly and never sticks to my iron skillet).</li>
<li>Place the coated tofu in the frying pan and turn heat</li>
<li>Cook for about 3-5 minutes on each side until golden brown and crunchy.</li>
</ol>
