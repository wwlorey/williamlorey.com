        <h1>Breaded Tofu</h1>

        <h2>Ingredients</h2>
        <ul>
        <li>Tofu - extra firm or the super firm high protein type work the best.</li>
        <li>Soy Sauce - or Tamari or Bragg's Liquid Aminos for flavor and to moisten the tofu and help the coating stick.</li>
        <li>Bread Crumbs - You can also crumble and use any of the following:</li>
        <ul>
            <li>crackers (any vegan cracker will work)</li>
            <li>a vegan stuffing (like Pepperidge Farm's cornbread stuffing mix).</li>
            <li>corn flakes (GF)</li>
            <li>corn chips (GF)</li>
            <li>Spicy Sweet Chili or Blaze flavored Doritos</li>
            <li>cornmeal. (GF)</li>
        </ul>
        <li>Flour - you can use white, whole wheat, or gluten-free flour mix.  This helps creates a coating that sticks to the tofu and crisps up when cooked.</li>
        <li>Corn Starch - to help the breading be extra crispy.  (optional)</li>
        <li>Nutritional Yeast - for flavor.  Optional, but recommended.</li>
        <li>Spices - this can vary depending on the flavor that you want to achieve.  I like to use poultry seasoning for a chicken nugget flavored tofu or Italian seasoning if I'm serving it with pasta or something Italian flavored.  I also like to use Tony Chachere's for a spicy creole flavored tofu too.  </li>
        <li>Salt - for flavor.  (You may want to reduce or omit if your spices already have salt in them).</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Instructions</h2>
        <ol>
        <li>Drain and press a block of tofu getting out as much liquid as possible.</li>
        <li>Mix together breading ingredients on a plate or shallow dish.</li>
        <li>Sprinkle tofu with some soy sauce or equivalent.</li>
        <li>Place the tofu in the breading and press down a little to make the coating stick to the tofu.</li>
        <li>Flip over and coat the other side.</li>
        </ol>

        <p>Now you have 2 choices to cook your tofu baking or pan frying.</p>
        <h3>Baking</h3>
        <ol>
        <li>Preheat the oven to 400°F.</li>
        <li>Spread about 2 tbsp of oil on the bottom of a cookie sheet.</li>
        <li>Place the breaded tofu on the cookie sheet and bake at 400°F for about 20 minutes.</li>
        <li>After 20 minutes, take out of the oven and flip with a spatula. </li>
        <li>Bake for an additional 20 minutes on the other side.</li>
        </ol>

        <h3>Pan frying</h3>
        <ol>
        <li>Place 2 tbsp of oil in the bottom of a skillet. (I highly recommend using an iron skillet for tofu.  It always cooks perfectly and never sticks to my iron skillet).</li>
        <li>Place the coated tofu in the frying pan and turn heat to medium-high.</li>
        <li>Cook for about 3-5 minutes on each side until golden brown and crunchy.</li>
        </ol>
