<ul>
<li>1-2 tablespoons olive oil OR water for oil free</li>
<li>1 small onion, diced small</li>
<li>2 small carrots, diced small</li>
<li>2 celery stalks, diced small</li>
<li>3 garlic cloves, minced</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="for-the-rest">For the rest</h3>
<ul>
<li>(2) 15 oz cans chickpeas, drained and rinsed, (3 cups)</li>
<li>1- 1 1/2 cups breadcrumbs</li>
<li>2 tablespoons ground flaxseed</li>
<li>3 tablespoons nutritional yeast</li>
<li>2 tablespoons soy sauce</li>
<li>2 tablespoons vegan Worcestershire sauce</li>
<li>1/4 cup ketchup</li>
<li>1/2 teaspoon liquid smoke, optional, but good</li>

<h3 id="for-the-topping">For the topping</h3>
<ul>

<li>1 teaspoon vegan Worcestershire sauce</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="instructions">Instructions</h2>
<ol type="1">
<li>Preheat the oven to 375 degrees and lightly spray a 9 inch loaf pan with oil, or line the bottom with parchment paper to prevent sticking.</li>
<li>Saute the onion, carrots, celery and garlic in the olive oil or water over medium heat for 5 minutes, until the onions are translucent. Remove from heat and set aside.</li>
<li>Add the chickpeas to a large bowl, and mash with a potato masher (or fork). You do not want them to be completely pasty or mushy, but well broken up. Alternatively, use a food processor, but be careful not to over blend them and make them totally mushy. Pulse a couple of times if using a food processor.</li>
<li>Add the cooked veggies and all the remaining ingredients to the chickpeas. I have found 1 cup of breadcrumbs to be enough, but if the mixture seems really moist, add an extra 1/2 cup. Stir with a large wooden spoon until very well combined.</li>
<li>Press the loaf mixture in the prepared pan, pushing down evenly with your hand. Cover with foil and bake for 30 minutes.</li>
<li>In a small bowl, stir together the ketchup and Worcestershire sauce for the topping.</li>
<li>After 30 minutes, remove the foil, spread the ketchup topping evenly on top of the loaf and bake for another 15 minutes, uncovered. Remove from the oven.</li>
<li>Allow to sit for at least 15 minutes before slicing if you can, it will hold up better. Sprinkle with fresh parsley if desired before serving.</li>
