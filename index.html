      <p class="content">The summer after my Freshman year I interned in Information Technology at Boeing.
        I am very greatful to have had the opportunity as it opened my eyes to what working in a professional
        enviornment is like. Most notably during my time at the company, I worked alongside a team of interns
        (pictured above) in the ITCS Intern Challenge to create a social network used for leveraging innovation
        from employees in my division. We competed against another intern team and won the competition.
