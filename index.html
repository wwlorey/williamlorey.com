    <p class="content">I have been a member of the <a href="https://solarcar.mst.edu/" target="_blank">Missouri S&amp;T
        Solar Car Team</a> ever since I began attending S&amp;T and it has proven to be very fun and rewarding activity.
        The team, comprised entirely of students, designs, builds, and races solar powered vehicles in competitions on world
        stages: most notably the <a href="http://americansolarchallenge.org/" target="_blank">American Solar Challenge</a>
        and <a href="https://www.worldsolarchallenge.org/" target="_blank">World Solar Challenge</a>.

    <p class="content">I am a member of the organization's Electrical sub-team as well as the Logistics Manager. As an
        Electrical sub-team member, I work on embedded programming projects as well as PCB assembly and design,
        vehicle wiring, and battery box upkeep. As the team's Logistics Manager, I am the head of the Logistics sub-team which
        coordinates efforts regarding getting the team, equipment, and car to races, as well as race strategy. Currently the
        Logistics sub-team is planning for the team's trip to the Bridgestone World Solar Challenge in Australia next Fall.

    <p class="content">The summer after my Freshman year I interned in Information Technology at Boeing.
      I am very grateful to have had the opportunity as it opened my eyes to what working in a professional
      environment is like. Most notably during my time at the company, myself and a team of Boeing interns in
      St. Louis (pictured above) were tasked with finding a way to leverage innovation in our department, IT Common Services (ITCS).
      Competing against another team in Seattle, we designed and built a social network for aggregating and cultivating
      innovation from IT employees. We presented our solution to our director and his leadership team and it was
      chosen to be implemented.
