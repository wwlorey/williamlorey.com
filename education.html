    </div>
    <div class="page-text">
      In my File Structures and Databases class, the culmination of the semester led to 
      a group project where teams of students implemented database 
      management systems. Our professor left the purpose of the system we created up to us.
      My group decided to create a web-based database system for the Solar Car 
      Team since a few of us were members of the team. The system we built catalogs team members, 
      electrical projects and systems, vehicles, competitions, and the relationships between them all.

    <div class="page-text">
      The application was built mainly in PHP with an SQL backend. My role on the team was to write most of the PHP, 
      HTML, and CSS code in the application as well as the user/database transactions. It was a fun project and a
      good way to start working with database systems.
