      The <a href="https://solarcar.mst.edu/" target="_blank">S&amp;T Solar Car Team</a> is an entirely student run organization
      that designs and builds solar powered vehicles. We compete in races such as the
      <a href="http://americansolarchallenge.org/about/american-solar-challenge/" target="_blank">American Solar Challenge</a> and
      <a href="http://americansolarchallenge.org/about/formula-sun-grand-prix/" target="_blank">Formula Sun Grand Prix</a> that
      draw competitors from all over the world.

      My role on the team has varied since I joined in 2015. I started out as an Electrical Sub-Team member with a focus on embedded programming. 
      While in that role, I developed code that controlled the lights, horn, and E-Stop on the upper body of the vehicle. I also made wires, assembled boards,
      and installed the vehicle's electrical systems.

      As a Sophomore, I was elected to the role of Logistics Manager. I led a 5-person sub-team in architecting the team's return to the
      World Solar Challenge in 2017. Due to lack of funding, the international competition was put on hold in favor of a less expensive domestic competition, 
      but my sub-team laid valuable groundwork for competing internationally in the future. Throughout the year in preparation, we gathered copious 
      information about racing in the Australian Outback (where the World Solar Challenge is held), built relationships with international logistics companies, 
      and became familiar with international shipping regulations.

      Now I am the President of the organization. As President, my responsibilities include managing the team's finances including creating 
      and carrying out team-wide budgeting as well as organizing and leading events such as internal design reviews, recruitment events, and drive days. 
      Being a part of the Solar Car Team has been a very rewarding experience, one that has helped me grow as an engineer and as a leader.

    <div class="page-text">
      Following my Sophomore year in college, I worked for the aerospace contractor LMI Aerospace in Cuba, Missouri. The plant I was 
      located at specialized in metal finishing and was home to over 130 employees. My role as the facility's sole developer was to 
      maintain the plant's IT infrastructure and implement new features to the system as needed, mainly using .NET technologies.

    <div class="page-text">
      In addition to maintaining and adding new features to existing .NET systems, I created a few stand-alone applications. One 
      was a web based emergency alert system that played emergency recordings over the plant's PA system. These recordings could 
      be triggered from any device on the network. Another application I build was a chemical tracking system. This maintained an 
      inventory of chemicals as they came into the facility and kicked off automatic notifications based on the chemical expiration 
      dates and their usage.

      The summer after my Freshman year I interned in Information Technology at Boeing. My team maintained software development tools 
      used by the company's IT workforce including GitLab, TFS, and Visual Studio. Most notably during my time at the company, myself and 
      a team of Boeing interns in St. Louis (pictured above) were tasked with finding a way to leverage innovation in our department, 
      IT Common Services (ITCS). Competing against another team in Seattle, we designed and built a social network for aggregating and cultivating 
      innovation from IT employees. We presented our solution to our director and his leadership team and won the competition.
